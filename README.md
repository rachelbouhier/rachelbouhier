- 👩‍💻 I’m a junior developer who loves everything that sparkles and delicious cakes ! (and promise I always share what I bake).

- 🐣 In my previous life, I studied Translation and Communication (I'm trilingual: French, English and German) and I worked in Digital Marketing in the Fashion industry.

- 💃 I love dancing to disco music, I sew in my spare time and I love trying out new restaurants and bars in Paris ! 

- 💪 I'm a feminist who deeply believes that we need more diversity in the tech industry. If you think so too then we'll get along nicely.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code (so far in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP) at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/"> Ada Tech School</a>.

- 💞️ I’m looking for an apprenticeship as a fullstack or frontend developer in Paris starting September 2021 (1 year contract, 4 days at the company, 1 day in school).

- 📫 You can send me a message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-bouhier/">on Linkedin</a>.
