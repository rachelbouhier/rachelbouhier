- 👩‍💻 I’m a junior developer who loves everything that sparkles and delicious cakes ! (and promise I always share what I bake).

- I graduated from <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/"> Ada Tech School</a> last October and did a one-year apprenticeship as a Symfony developer for a start-up called <a href="https://www.tekyn.com/"> Tekyn</a>.

- 🐣 In my previous life, I studied Translation and Communication (I'm trilingual: French, English and German) and I worked in Digital Marketing in the Fashion industry.

- 💃 I love dancing to disco music, I sew in my spare time and I love trying out new restaurants and bars in Paris ! 

- 💪 I'm a feminist who deeply believes that we need more diversity in the tech industry. If you think so too then we'll get along nicely.

- 🌱 I’m currently gaining more experience on Symfony and React.

- 💞️ I’m looking for my next adventure as a backend or fullstack developer in France or abroad.
